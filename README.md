# MILP-tool-for-cryptanalysis-of-block-ciphers
This tool is able to construct the MILP model for some bit-oriented block ciphers. 
the codes are written in python 3, and inorder to use the tool you need to install pyqt.5 and gurobi on your system
by running the "main.py" you can get access to the tool
once you described the block-cipher on the tool, you can do differential and linear cryptanalysis on it. It is also suitable to find impossible input and output, which helps you in impossible differential attack, and zero-correlation attack. 
The MILP models are based on Gurobi format. In the link (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VkDEjezc8PJR6m0JA8kaizTNV4IjLT1W ) you can see how the tool works
